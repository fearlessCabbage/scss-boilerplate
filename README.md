# SCSS Boilerplate

This is scss code that I deploy with all my custom projects. It features a base with some utility classes that can be compiled and dropped into a project. The other folders follow a structure that I find helpful for developing WordPress themes.

## Installation & Usage

Download the entire package and run any of the commands in `package.json`. Run `scss:watch`, `scss:deploy`, `scss:compile-base`. The latter command compiles only base styles.
